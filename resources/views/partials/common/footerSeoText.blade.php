                <h1 class="BP2019H1">The best backpage Alternative website</h1>
                <p>
                    Backpage (previously on backpage.com) was a similar website to craigslist where you could post free
                    and paid classified ads as well as sell and buy listings, from RE to Cars, equipment, services
                    adult, and more.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Over time it grew to become one of the most visited classified ads websites in the US, and it was so
                    popular that it also attracted visitors from other Tier 1 English-speaking countries.
                    However and for legal reasons, backpage.com was seized by the FBI in 2018 which left a lot of their
                    users not knowing where to go to find classifieds.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Back page users couldn't post classified ads on the website and started looking for alternatives.
                    Some alternatives to backpage started to appear, but they weren't legitimate websites and had
                    dubious practices, which meant advertisers were still unable to post successfully and make money
                    doing so.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Due to US laws, there are a lot of challenges when it comes to classified sites and we've put a lot
                    of time and effort to make our services trustworthy, law compliant and work against child sex
                    traffic, child abuse, or any illegal practices.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We believe adult services are part of what any person should be able to have access to, and
                    therefore we're building our classified adult service section to support the industry.
                </p>
                <h2>Why is {{ config()->get('services.application.slugName') }} the best alternative to backpage
                    classifieds?</h2>
                <p>
                    After backpage.com shut down and a myriad of non-trusted websites emerged, we focused
                    {{ config()->get('services.application.slugName') }} to
                    be a
                    safe space for adults to find adult topics safe and as private as possible, at the same time we
                    allow
                    advertisers to offer their services on our website.
                    We are the bridge between the previous backpage classified website and the general public.
